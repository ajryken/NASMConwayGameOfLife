# Conway's Game of Life (64-Bit NASM)

This is a simple, configurable version of "Conway's Game of Life", with a simple start screen and a generation counter.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Make is used to build the program using nasm and gcc.

## Installing

**LINUX**
* The program will compile using the 'make' command and will execute with './GameofLife'.

**WINDOWS**
* Download and install GnuWin32 from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
* You will also need to download and install MinGW if you do not already have it. This is needed to run gcc on the Windows command line interface.
* After these are installed, you can use the same commands as the Linux instructions to get the program up and running.
* You can edit the source code using your preferred IDE but SASM (https://dman95.github.io/SASM/english.html) is a great IDE for all major assembly languages. I suggest you install and use this IDE for assembly language programming as it was made specifically for assembly languages.
