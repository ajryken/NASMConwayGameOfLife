# Conway's Game of Life (64-Bit NASM)

This is a simple, configurable version of "Conway's Game of Life", with a simple start screen and a generation counter."

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Make is used to build the program using nasm and gcc. On Windows systems, 

## Installing

Preferably using a Linux system, the program will compile using the 'make' command and will execute with './GameofLife'.

Using a Windows system, download and install GnuWin32 from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
You will also need to download and install MinGW if you do not already have it. This is needed to run gcc on the Windows command line interface.
You can edit the source code using your preferred IDE but SASM (https://dman95.github.io/SASM/english.html) is a great IDE for all major assembly languages. I suggest you install and use this IDE for assembly language programming as it was made specifically for assembly languages.
